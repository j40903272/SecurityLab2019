### California SB-327 Information privacy: connected devices.
SB 327, Jackson. Information privacy: connected devices.
Existing law requires a business to take all reasonable steps to dispose of customer records within its custody or control containing personal information when the records are no longer to be retained by the business by shredding, erasing, or otherwise modifying the personal information in those records to make it unreadable or undecipherable. Existing law also requires a business that owns, licenses, or maintains personal information about a California resident to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information, to protect the personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. Existing law authorizes a customer injured by a violation of these provisions to institute a civil action to recover damages.
This bill, beginning on January 1, 2020, would require a manufacturer of a connected device, as those terms are defined, to equip the device with a reasonable security feature or features that are appropriate to the nature and function of the device, appropriate to the information it may collect, contain, or transmit, and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure, as specified.

### The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which implemented the warnings and agreements that pop up on websites.
GDPR reshapes the way in which sectors manage data, as well as redefines the roles for key leaders in businesses, from CIOs to CMOs. CIOs must ensure that they have watertight consent management processes in place, whilst CMOs require effective data rights management systems to ensure they don’t lose their most valuable asset – data.

The aim of the GDPR is to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in today’s data-driven world. Although the key principles of data privacy still hold true to the previous directive, many changes have been proposed to the regulatory policies; the key points of the GDPR as well as information on the impacts it will have on business can be found below.

Arguably the biggest change to the regulatory landscape of data privacy comes with the extended jurisdiction of the GDPR, as it applies to all companies processing the personal data of data subjects residing in the Union, regardless of the company’s location. Previously, territorial applicability of the directive was ambiguous and referred to data process ‘in context of an establishment’. This topic has arisen in a number of high profile court cases. GDPR makes its applicability very clear – it applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. The GDPR also applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the activities relate to: offering goods or services to EU citizens (irrespective of whether payment is required) and the monitoring of behaviour that takes place within the EU. Non-EU businesses processing the data of EU citizens also have to appoint a representative in the EU.

### 資通安全管理法
為積極推動國家資通安全政策，加速建構國家資通安全環境，以保障國家
安全，維護社會公共利益，特制定本法。

行政院資安處將依法繼續制定相關的《資通安全管理法施行細則》、《資通安全責任等級分級辦法》、《資通安全情資分享辦法》、《資通安全事件通報及應變辦法》、《特定非公務機關資通安全維護計畫》以及《公務機關所屬人員辦理資通安全業務獎懲辦法

相較歐盟 即將上路的 GDPR 的最高罰金是台幣7億2千萬，台灣剛通過的資安法則是祭出 - 未來各公務機關應設置資安長，推動及監督資安事務；若遇資安事件未通報，最高可處新台幣500萬元罰鍰。

### New IoT Security Regulations - Schneier on Security - Summary
The Internet of Things risen the risk of having personal information stolen or devices being overtaken and controlled remotely. For devices that affect the world in a direct physical manner -- cars, pacemakers, thermostats -- the risks include loss of life and property. California's new SB 327 law, which will take effect in January 2020, requires all "connected devices" to have a "reasonable security feature". Though the legislation covers only the state of California, its effects will reach much further since it's much easier to maintain the single, more secure version and sell it everywhere. Once a government steps in and imposes more stringent security regulations, companies have an incentive to meet those standards as quickly, cheaply, and effectively as possible.

### My reflection
It would be hard to define a "reasonable security". The law would be unenforceable and cannot be specified one by one. However, I think it would be best to push the security on IOT industry and only by forcing these security demand, companies will make the IOT products securely. Maybe making legislate security certifications would be a good way to regulate security.

### My different opinion
The news article mentioned that the law would benifit outside of California because software company would only make one version of product which is the secure one. However, I think it is more possible that the companies will abandom the market in California since security is a huge cost. Especially security for devices that are several years old. Will the manufacturer keep supporting that 10 year old TV or fridge? Probably not.
